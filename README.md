NzbDroneMac
===========

I've created a little app for the Mac that monitors NzbDrone's status, does updating, etc

https://github.com/jefbarn/NzbDroneMac/releases/

This is the first go, so it might be a little rough around the edges.

Features:
Status menu icon
Manual update check
Looks Mono on startup
Run at login option
open web interface from menu

It's written in the new Swift language (just for fun), so you'll need 10.9 (Mavericks) to run.
